    My name is Niall Pringle and I am currently a Creative Digital Media student at the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown. I am in my first year of four and currently studying modules that involve video, photography, graphic design and web site design. My goal during my time here at college is to better myself in these areas and eventually focus my career in one of these sectors 
<h4> Background info </h4>
I am 18 years old, I currently live in Blanchardstown so it is easier to attend college. I am originally from West London in England and moved to Mullingar in Co. West Meath when I was 12.
<h4> Interests</h4>
I have a passion for playing music, I currently play bass guitar in a band which keeps me busy on my weekends. I also love film and video whether itâ€™s filming and editing footage I have captured or simply watching other creations people have made, I admire the work people put in to film. I enjoy playing video games also when I have some free time.
